Simple-Isometric-Game
=====================

A simple libGDX demo, for an isometric game.

Hints about building and running:

1) Gradle builds a NON-working GWT version in *cygwin*.
2) gradle html:dist creates a deployable version, under html\build\dist
3) gradle html:superDev create a "directly running" version. I think it can somehow be debugged into the web-browser console.
4) I think gradle html:superDev does not work in Firefox for me, but it does work in Chrome.
5) For Android: gradlew android:installDebug android:run does the job.
